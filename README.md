# Music-Scraper
Scrapes music from youtube using python and several libraries.<br/>
To use this download scraper.exe and place it in a folder that contains a music.txt file.<br/>
Within this music.txt put one song per line. Due to ads on YouTube some music will fail to download<br/>
To make the scraper more accurate put the artist as well as the title on the same line.<br/>
This works better because the scraper locates video links with a Youtube search query.<br/>
All music will be placed in a new Music subfolder also created by the program.<br/>
